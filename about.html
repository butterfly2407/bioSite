            <h3>All About Myles</h3>
            <img src="images/Self_portrait.jpg" alt="About Image" style="width: 250px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
            <p class="caption">Myles is a 23 year-old Columbia, SC native, but has since relocated to his family’s hometown in Manning, SC after graduation.
                Growing up, Myles recalls being well taken care of, being accompanied by family, and a time where his mother raised him and his older sister on her own at some point. These experiences
                contributed to the man he is today. He enjoys being in the country and is still surrounded by his family. Myles works as a maintenance mechanic and enjoys hunting in his pastime if he’s not visiting his family. So far, his accomplishments include graduating high school and college.
                Some goals he has for 2025 are to upgrade his pickup truck and get an LLC to contribute to his future goal of starting his own painting business. One of his fondest memories is his first time hunting at 7-years-old. He remembers his uncle explaining what to do when a deer approached them and just stopped. His uncle shot at the deer and missed and the dogs began chasing after the deer when it tried to flee. Myles was able to get the deer down and scored his first kill on his first day!
                Someone Myles looks up to is his cousin, Jay. Jay also played a big role in contributing to who Myles is today. He was there throughout his childhood guiding Myles into manhood. They are very close and do pretty much everything together til this day. One quote Myles lives by is “If you try and you fail, get up and try again.” This quote simply means that anything worth having is worth fighting for. Don’t give up and keep going!</p>
